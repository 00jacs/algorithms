# Algorithmic Problems & Solutions

This is a collection of problems & solutions from Hackerrank and Leetcode that I will update from time to time based on the problems I solve. I also plan to create roadmaps ("learn dp", "learn greedy", "learn BFS", "Amazon Problemset", "Google Problemset") in the upcoming future.

## Why these platforms?

🧠 It's the best way to practice coding problems. It's like a gym for your brain. You can't get better at coding without practicing.

📈 It's a great way to track your progress. You can see how you're improving over time.

🏆 It's a great way to compete with others. You can see how you're doing compared to others.

💸 It makes getting a tech job 10x easier (thus, more $$$ for you)
